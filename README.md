# 12NME - Numerical Methods

This repository contains auxiliary study materials for undergraduate course <b>12NME - Numerical Methods</b> lectured at the Faculty of Nuclear Sciences and Physical Engineering, Czech Technical University in Prague (http://kfe.fjfi.cvut.cz/~valenpe7/).

The study materials currently consist of only the implementation of selected numerical methods and algorithms (without comments). For closer info, you should attend the tutorials. The methods are written in Python, and organized into Jupyter notebooks.

### How to obtain the study materials:

All the notebooks are stored in **[this](https://github.com/valenpe7/numerical_methods)** github repository under the **[lectures](https://github.com/valenpe7/numerical_methods/tree/master/lectures)** directory. You may either **[download](https://github.com/valenpe7/numerical_methods/archive/master.zip)** all the notebooks as a .zip archive by selecting "Code" and then "Download ZIP", or use `git`:

1. Clone the repository: ``` $> git clone https://github.com/mspieg/intro-numerical-methods.git ```
2. Pull in new changes: ``` $> git pull ```

alternatively, you can:

* Launch the notebooks with **Jupyter NBViwever** (non-interactive): https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/valenpe7/numerical_methods/blob/master/index.ipynb
* Launch the notebooks with **Binder** (interactive): https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/valenpe7/numerical_methods/master?filepath=index.ipynb

If you find any mistake, please submit an **[issue](https://github.com/valenpe7/numerical_methods/issues)** to this github project page.
